üéØ How It Works

Admin uploads questions and pre-registers student details with voice samples.

Candidate logs in via voice authentication ‚Äî the system maps voice to stored data.

Exam interface reads questions aloud and records spoken answers.

Candidates can modify answers via LLM but cannot get direct AI-generated answers.

Answers are stored in Firestore and can be reviewed by admin.

System generates PDF of answers for record keeping.
